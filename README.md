# Dodgepong
Top-down bullet-hell game, implemented in Godot, where you play as a tennis table player trying to escape a mortal game of dodgeball created by your abusive coach.

This project uses the [Top-down Starter Project By ForlornU](https://github.com/ForlornU/TopdownStarter) as the initial template.
